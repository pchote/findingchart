A Flask + Bootstrap + jQuery web tool for generating finding charts for astronomical targets with proper motions.
Source images are pulled from the STScl Digitized Sky Survey archive, and annotated with the estimated target position at the requested observing epoch.

Annotated charts are displayed in the browser, and can be downloaded as a zip file.
